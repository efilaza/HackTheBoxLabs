Step 6: Trying to connect to available shares

Since we do not have any  credentials we try to connect to a share which is probably left unattended by mistake thus we won't insert a password

Fisrt attempt > smbclient \\\\"target ip"\\ADMIN$

No luck!!!!
Second attempt > smbclient \\\\"target ip"\\C$

No luck!!!
